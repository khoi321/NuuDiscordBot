### Replace TOKEN in source code

1. Open the bot's source file (e.g. `bot.mjs`).

2. Find the line containing `client.login('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN');`.

3. Replace `'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN'` with the TOKEN you copied from the Discord Developer Portal:

```js
client.login('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN'); // Replace YOUR_BOT_TOKEN with your bot token

node -v
npm -v

``
- If you see the version information, it means Node.js and npm are installed. If not, you need to install Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

- Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory containing your project. For example:

``bash
cd project_directory_path

``

3. **Install the required packages**:

- Make sure you have a `package.json` file in your project directory. This file contains a list of packages that you need to install.
- Run the following command to install all packages listed in `package.json`:
```bash
npm install
```
- If you want to install a specific package, use the command:
```bash
npm install package-name
```
For example, to install `discord.js`, you would run:
```bash
npm install discord.js
```

4. **Checking installed packages**:

- The packages will be installed in the `node_modules` directory and the list of packages will be updated in the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files.

### 3. Checking the Activity

- **Checking Installed Packages:**
- You can check the installed packages using the command:
```bash
npm list
```
- This command will list all packages and their versions.

- **Check Node.js and npm Versions:**

- To make sure you are using the correct version of Node.js and npm, you can check their versions with the following commands:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```
## How to Use Terminal to Run Discord Bot Using Node.js on VS Code

### 1. Open Project and Terminal

1. **Open VS Code:**
- Launch Visual Studio Code on your computer.

2. **Open Project:**
- Open your Discord bot project by selecting **File** -> **Open Folder...** and navigate to the folder containing the project.

3. **Open Terminal:**
- Press the key combination `Ctrl + `` (grave accent) to open Terminal in VS Code.

- Or you can open Terminal by going to menu **Terminal** -> **New Terminal**.

### 2. Running the Discord Bot

1. **Go to the Project Folder:**
- If you are not already in your project folder, use the `cd` command in Terminal to navigate to the project folder:
```bash
cd_path_to_project_folder
```

2. **Running the Bot Using Node.js:**

- To launch the Discord bot, you use the `node` command to run the bot's main file. The main file is `bot.mjs` For example:
```bash
node bot.mjs
```
**or**
```bash
node .
```
- After this command is executed, your bot will run and you will see a status message in Terminal (if the bot is configured to print out statuses when running).

### 3. Checking the Bot's Performance

1. **Checking the Bot's Messages:**
- In the Terminal, you will see messages when your bot successfully launches, such as:

```
Ready!
Bot Started
Logged in as BotName#1234!

```

2. **Connecting the Bot to the Discord Server:**
- Make sure you have added your bot to the Discord server by creating an invite URL and granting permissions to the bot.

- When the bot successfully runs, it will start working on the server you invited it to.

3. **Stopping the Bot:**
- If you want to stop the bot, you can press the `Ctrl + C` key combination in the Terminal.

### 4. Debugging and Troubleshooting

- **Checking for Errors:**
- If the bot is not working as expected or encounters errors, error messages will appear in the Terminal. You can check the errors to know what to fix.

- **Edit Error Code:**

- If you encounter an error, edit the code in your bot file, then run the command `node bot.mjs` to restart the bot.

### 5. Automatically Run the Bot (Optional)

- If you want your bot to automatically restart when there is a change, you can use a tool like `nodemon`. To install `nodemon`, run the command:

```bash
npm install -g nodemon

```
- Then you can start the bot with the command

```
nodemon bot.mjs

```
- This command will automatically restart the bot every time you change the code.

# Result
- After running `node .` on Terminal in VS Code, you will see the bot online.
- The default prefix of the bot is `!`

# Install NECESSARY packages
- Go to `import.txt`
- Copy package game
- run
  ```bash
  npm install <package_name>
  ```
  replace `<package_name>` with package exist in `import.txt`

  # Change the bot's FREFIX
  - The default prefix of the bot is `!`
  - Go to `bot.mjs`
    ```js
     client.on('messageCreate', async message => {
    if (!message.content.startsWith('!') || message.author.bot) return; // thay thế ! thành perfix riêng của bạn

    const args = message.content.slice(1).trim().split(/ +/);
    const commandName = args.shift().toLowerCase();

    const command = client.commands.get(commandName);
    ```
    Replace `!` with your own prefix.
